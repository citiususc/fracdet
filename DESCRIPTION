Title: models 1/f noise + deterministic oscillations
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Constantino Antonio Garcia Martinez
Maintainer: Constantino A. Garcia <constantinoantonio.garcia@usc.es>
Description: The 'fracdet' package implements a simple, yet realistic,
  fractal-deterministic model that may be able to capture key features of
  complex time series. The package also provides functionality that, under the
  assumptions of this model, is able to characterize the fractal component and
  to provide an estimation of the deterministic components present in a given
  time series.
